        <p>
            Fragment Tree is a <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html" class="cLinkg">MonoBehaviour</a> that controls
            a group of structure pieces (called fragments) to mimic the behaviour of a destructible solid.
        </p>
        <h2>The way it works</h2>
        <p>
            To make Fragment Tree work, you will need to have a pre-fragmented model of your structure. This can easily be achieved with free softwares
            like Blender. The Fragment Tree works by first scanning the model. It will detect any intersecting fragments and link them together as
            neighbors. The collection of all linked shapes is represented by the fragment tree.
        </p>

        <br />
        <p>
            Once the graph is setup, the Fragment Tree will react to incoming physical impacts. It will compare the force received to the material
            hardness and decide weather the fragment breaks of the structure or not. The impact will also be propagated to neighboring fragments
            based on their distance, their orientation and the material's elasticity. This means the destruction behaviour is controlled by only
            2 properties:<br />
            <h4>
                &emsp;Hardness = The impact forced needed to break fragment links
                <br />&emsp;Elasticity = The propagation of the impact force. More elasticity means the impact will not propagate far
            </h4>
            One of the strengths of Fragment Tree is that once disturbed by an impact, the fragments can break off into other fragment trees.
            You could, for instance, break a long metal rod into two seperate medium-length rods that could then be broken down again.
