        <h1>Tri-Colored Sprite</h1>
        <p>
            Tri-Colored Sprite is a set of asset that allows you to easily render the same sprites with different colors. The system works
            with a trio of color. Each specified color will be applied to a one of the 3 RGB channels. The final pixel color will be calculate as such:
        </p>
        <h4>
            pixelColor = (spriteR * colorA) + (spriteG * colorB) + (spriteB * colorC);
        </h4>
        <br />
        <h2>TriColored Component</h2>
        <p>
            The TriColored Component is a component that can be added to any GameObject with the SpriteRenderer component. The component will
            change the SpriteRenderer's shader and apply the Tri-Colored pattern with it's three colors.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's look at an example. Here we have the original image of a canon. Without the Tri-Colored pattern applied, it doesn't look so good.
            That's because the 3 color channels have been specifically arranged to be used with the technique. In our case the first channel (R)
            represents the lighting. Most of the image is black, but everywhere light would normally create shades or reflections, the value gets closer
            to 1. The remaining two channels (G and B) each represent the base color of a part of the canon. That way, we can easily change the color of
            the tubes independently from the main frame.
        </p>

        <br /><br />
        <p>
            Now let's add a TriColored component to our sprite and set it's 3 colors to:
            <br />(R) light: grey
            <br />(G) color X: orange
            <br />(B) color Y: dark metallic blue
        </p>
        <img src="/ProjetWeb/Images/doc/2D/tricoloredsprite/effect.png" class="center" />
        <br /><br />
        <p>
            If we were to change the 3rd color (B) to, let's say, green, only the canon's tubes would get affected.
        </p>
        <img src="/ProjetWeb/Images/doc/2D/tricoloredsprite/effect2.png" class="center" />
        <br /><br />
        <p>
            This rendering technique allows you to render the same sprite with many different colors. However, it should be noted that this technique
            only allows for a sprite to be composed of 3 additive colors. This means the Tri-Colored pattern is not helpful in every cases.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Scripting</h2>
        <p>
            Modifying the color values of the TriColored component is fairly straight-forward. However, if you want to modify more than one color at a
            time, you may use the SetColors(...) method instead of the standard properties to save a bit of CPU time.
        </p>
        

<code><span class="cClass">TriColored</span> triColored = GetComponent&lt;<span class="cClass">TriColored</span>&gt;();
        
<span class="cComment">// Set individual properties</span>
triColored.ColorR = <span class="cClass">Color</span>.red;

triColored.ColorB = <span class="cClass">Color</span>.black;

<span class="cComment">// OR set them all at once</span>
triColored.SetColors(<span class="cClass">Color</span>.red, <span class="cClass">Color</span>.white, <span class="cClass">Color</span>.black);</code>
