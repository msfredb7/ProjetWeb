        <h1>Never Reaching Curve</h1>
        <p>
            Never Reaching Curve is a mathematical curve stored as a object. More specifically, it represents an instance of a rational function
            (a function that can be expressed as a rational fraction). The instance will return a Y value when you prompt it with an X value.
            The function is defined with 4 parameters as such:
        </p>
        <h4>Parameters</h4>
        <p>
            a = The lowest value you expect the curve to return (inclusive)<br />
            b = The highest value you expect the curve to return (exclusive)<br />
            minX = The lowest input value (X) you expect to prompt the curve with<br />
            speed = The level of curvature. The higher the value, the faster the curve will get close to B
        </p>
        <h4>Formula</h4>
        <p>
            y = (1 / speed * (-x + minX + (1 / speed * (a - b)))) + b
        </p>

        <br />
        <p class="center">
            If we were to use the following parameter values:
            <br />&emsp;a = 0
            <br />&emsp;b = 4
            <br />&emsp;minX = 2
            <br />&emsp;speed = 0.5
            <br />the curve would look like this:

        <h2>Example</h2>
        <p>
            Never Reaching Curve can be used in many different cases, but it is especially useful when dealing with number
            balancing. For this example, let's say we're in a racing game and we want to adjust the volume of our car engine.
            We expect the engine's volume to increase as the player's speed increases. However, we don't want the correlation
            to be linear. We want the volume to progressively increase without ever reaching a certain limit.
            <br /><br />
            This case could be easily be resolved using a Never Reaching Curve as such:<br />
