        <h1>What's CCC ?</h1>
        <p>
            CCC is a collection of useful C# scripts built for Unity.<br />
            <br />
            They range from neat Property Drawers to complex mathematical algorithms and more. The best way to get a grasp of what CCC is
            would simply be to explore the <a href="/ProjetWeb/htmls/documentation.html" class="cLink">documentation</a>. Here's a brief
            overview of some of the things you'll find in CCC:
            <br />
            <br /> &emsp;&emsp;-&emsp;Persistent object management tools that help you set up a collection of global managers quickly
            <br /> &emsp;&emsp;-&emsp;Alternative sprite coloring techniques
            <br /> &emsp;&emsp;-&emsp;Common UI animations
            <br /> &emsp;&emsp;-&emsp;Useful field attributes that provide fast and easy ways to adapt the inspector to your needs
            <br /> &emsp;&emsp;-&emsp;Audio systems that solve common development pattern problems
            <br /> &emsp;&emsp;-&emsp;Type extensions that make your code smaller and more readable
            <br /> &emsp;&emsp;-&emsp;Various mathematical tools that help you control your numbers the way you want
            <br /> &emsp;&emsp;-&emsp;File serialization systems that make loading and saving quite easier and faster
            <br /> &emsp;&emsp;-&emsp;Various useful data structures
            <br /> &emsp;&emsp;-&emsp;A list of time-saving UI classes like 'Infinite Scrollers'
            <br /> &emsp;&emsp;-&emsp;And more...
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Can I use CCC freely?</h2>
        <p>
            Absolutely! You can use/modify every CCC script however you want. The code base is entirely royalty-free and open source.
            This means giving CCC credit is appreciated but not mandatory :)
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>What's the story behind CCC?</h2>
        <p>
            The CCC library was gradually built by myself (Frederic Bessette) across several game projects. I began aggregating some of
            my scripts that were project-independent about a year ago. Many assets were added, modified or completely deleted across the months.
            Now, I feel like the library is sufficiently 'clean' to be shared. However, none of the scripts are perfects. Some are unfinished,
            and others violate good coding practices, so take this library with a grain of salt.
            <br /> NB: Some of the scripts and systems were inspired by others shared on the internet.
